# pgoapi - a python pokemon go api lib/demo
pgoapi is a client/api/demo for Pokemon Go by https://github.com/tejado.  
It allows automatic parsing of requests/responses by finding the correct protobuf objects over a naming convention and will return the response in a parsed python dictionary format.   

 * This is unofficial - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !
 * I don't play pokemon go !
 * No bot/farming code included !

## Supports
 * Python 2 and 3
 * Google/PTC auth
 * Address parsing for GPS coordinates
 * Allows chaining of RPC calls
 * Good logging/debugging possibilities
 * Easy extension of further calls! No source code change required!
 * Uses [POGOProtos](https://github.com/AeonLucid/POGOProtos)
 * Following RPC calls:
   * GET_PLAYER
   * GET_INVENTORY
   * GET_MAP_OBJECTS
   * DOWNLOAD_SETTINGS
   * DOWNLOAD_ITEM_TEMPLATES
   * CHECK_AWARDED_BADGES
   * FORT_SEARCH (spinning of pokestops)

   * EVOLVE_POKEMON
   * ...
   * more should be possible now but have to be tested (PLEASE support here)

## pgoapi extension
All (known) RPC calls against the original Pokemon Go servers are listed in the RequestMethod Enum in the pgoapi/protos/RpcEnum.proto file. These can be executed over the name, e.g. the call for get_player is:

    api = PGoApi()
    ...
    api.get_player()
    api.call()
    
The pgoapi will send this as a RPC request and tries to parse the response over a protobuf object with the same name (get_player) converted to CamelCase + 'Response'. In our example, it would be 'GetPlayerResponse'. These protobuf definitions have to be inside RpcSub (pgoapi/protos/RpcSub.proto).

If a request needs parameters, they can be added as arguments and pgoapi will try to add them automatically to the request, e.g.:

    *RpcSub.proto:*
    message DownloadSettingsRequest {
      optional string hash = 1;
    }
    
    *python:*
    api = PGoApi()
    ...
    api.download_settings(hash="4a2e9bc330dae60e7b74fc85b98868ab4700802e")
    api.call()
